This program uses markov chaining, which is a probabilistic model that can be applied to many different cases, in order to analyze the data input and then randomly generate messages. Markov chaining can be used for and is used in many applications, such as predictive text and modeling of systems such as weather forecasts. My implementation of markov chaining utilizes a hashmap that essentially functions as a histogram, containing all next possible states from the current model, which can also be likened to a directed graph structure. The next possible state is then obtained by performing a weighted selection using a probability mass function, which normalizes the number of occurences of each state in the histogram so that the sum of all the probabilities totals one (1).

In order to avoid sentences being generated with words entirely capitalized, I originally opted to retain information on each word to indicate if it was previously capitalized in the data, and to only capitalize the start of every sentence. This, of course, means that proper nouns are not properly capitalized in the middle of a sentence. The main option I am considering is using Named Entity Recognition in order to capitalize the words, but most of the ones I have seen require use of machine learning, which is currently beyond the scope of this project. After some more review, I realized that while there is the potential for entirely uppercase words to be added, most people do not speak entirely in capital letters, so the chances of such a sentence being generated is slim (but not none). Therefore I removed my algorithm's original rules for capitalization and automatic lowercasing, and instead am relying on the fact that most people type normally. This had led to a more natural-looking sentence when generated by the algorithm.

I chose to use the Apache Commons and Twitter4J libraries because I understand that I currently lack the technical capability of properly implementing the functionality I sought in a bug-free, efficient, and optimized manner.
